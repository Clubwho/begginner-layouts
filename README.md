# Beginner Layouts

This is a tutorial and example based layout used to teach people about [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg).

This layout goes over 3 levels that assist when looking at more advanced layouts such as [AGDQ 2018](https://github.com/GamesDoneQuick/agdq18-layouts) and [Tip of the Hats 2017](https://github.com/TipoftheHats/toth5-overlay).
The 3 levels are: Barebones, GSAP and Polymer.
